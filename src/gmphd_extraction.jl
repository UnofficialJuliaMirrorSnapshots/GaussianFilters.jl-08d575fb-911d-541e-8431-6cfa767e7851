"""
    multiple_target_state_extraction(b::GaussianMixture, th::Real)

Extracts targets whose weights (x.w) are above threshold.

Arguments:
    `b::GaussianMixture`: Set of Gaussian Mixtures
    `th::Real`: Threshold on weights. Above this threshold,
    state estimate is extracted

Returns:
    X: Multi-Target State Estimate
